<h3 id="h-add-file">Adding a file</h3>
<p>
To be able to create a link to a document from your articles or news
you need to have the document available on the server. To do that an
interface is provided to you to transfer a file from your computer to
the server. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the folder in which you want to add a file, you may 
<a href="#h-sub-folder">create a sub-folder</a> to match your needs.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Browse...</strong> button. A file explorer
window will pop-up giving you access to the files on your computer</li>
<li>Navigate into your files to find the one of interest. Select it, and
validate by clicking on <strong>Open</strong> or pressing <em>Enter</em>
depending on your system. This will close the file explorer window.</li>
<li>Now click on the <strong>Add the file</strong> button, this will
transfer the file on the server in the current folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Depending on your internet connection the transfer can take some time,
be patient. You need to be carefull that the name of your file must
not contain any spaces.

<h3 id="h-sub-folder">Creating a sub-folder</h3>
<p>
When your website will grow, you will start to manage a lot of files,
they can be pdf files, images or application files. If you save all the
files in the default document folder, you will soon reach the point where
it will be very hard to find again your files. To avoid that you should
create sub-folders within the default document folder to group your
files by category. You can create any number of sub-folders depending
of your needs.
