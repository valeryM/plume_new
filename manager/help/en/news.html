<h3 id="h-category">Category of the news</h3>
<p>
When you create a new news, you need to put it into a category. You can imagine
that like putting a news into a folder to group them by themes.
</p>
<p>
A news can be part of multiple categories but it has only one <em>Main</em> category.
When you create a news, the first category you select will be the <em>Main</em> category.
After saving the news for the first time, you will have the possibility to put the news
in more categories and also change the main category to another. These changes are done with
the little icons in the list of categories of the news.
</p>

<h3 id="h-format">Format of the news</h3>
<p>
The format is the way you want to type in the content of the news. You can provide directly
<strong>HTML</strong> content. This is complex, but it provides a lot of flexibility. You can also provide the
content in an alternative syntax, the so called <strong>Wiki</strong> syntax. The Wiki syntax
is a simplified but powerfull way to provide the content of your news. It is recommended
to always use the Wiki syntax if you do not have special needs.
</p>

<h3 id="h-status">Status of the news</h3>
<p>
The status of a news defines for example if the news can be seen by the visitors on the website.
Depending on your rights you can set the news as:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>On-Line</dt><dd>The news can be seen on the website.</dd>
<dt>Off-Line</dt><dd>The news is kept in the database but not displayed.</dd>
<dt>In edition</dt><dd>The author (you) is working on the news.</dd>
<dt>Waiting for validation</dt><dd>The author (you) has finished working on the news and is
waiting a reviewer to validate it.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="h-comments">Status of the comments</h3>
<p>
The status of the comments defines if the ressource should accept comments by the visitors on the website or not.
Depending on your rights you can set this status to:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Comments open</dt><dd>The comment form is displayed on the resource page.</dd>
<dt>Comments closed</dt><dd>The comment form is not displayed, no comments can be added.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="h-title">Title of the news</h3>
<p>
This should be self explanatory. The title of the news will be displayed on all the pages refering to
the news.
</p>

<h3 id="h-content">Content of the news</h3>
<p>
The content of the news is provided in the <a href="#h-format">format</a> you have selected.
</p>

<h3 id="h-keywords">Keywords of the news</h3>
<p>
The keywords are a list of comma delimited words. For example you can put:
<em>Monotremata, Tachyglossidae, Kollikodontidae, Platanistoidae, river dolphins</em>.
The keywords can be composed of 2 words like <em>river dolphins</em>.
</p>
<p>
The keywords are of course used in the internal search engine, but also in the news
page to give more details about the page for the global search engines like Google.
</p>

<h3 id="h-asso-title">Associated website title</h3>
<p>
When creating a news, a reference website can be provided if available. Just put here the
title.
</p>

<h3 id="h-asso-address">Associated website address</h3>
<p>
Just put <a href="#h-asso-title">reference website</a> address. The address must start with
<em>http://</em>. Alternatively, you can put a link to file on a FTP file server with a link
starting with <em>ftp://</em>.
</p>

<h3 id="h-publication-date">Publication date</h3>
<p>
The publication date it the date and time at which the news start to be available on
the website. If you give a date and time in the future, you can publish a news while
you are away.
</p>

<h3 id="h-expiration-date">Expiration date</h3>
<p>
The expiration date it the date and time at which the news stop to be available on
the website. You can use this date to create for example a news for a limited time
for a special event. It is recommended not to abuse of it, as visitors through
search engines like not to fall on pages that are not here anymore.
