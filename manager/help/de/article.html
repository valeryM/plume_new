<h3 id="h-category">Category of the article</h3>
<p>
When you create a new article, you need to put it into a category. You can imagine
that like putting an article into a folder to group them by themes.
</p>
<p>
An article can be part of multiple categories but it has only one <em>Main</em> category.
When you create an article, the first category you select will be the <em>Main</em> category.
After saving the article for the first time, you will have the possibility to put the article
in more categories and also change the main category to another. These changes are done with
the little icons in the list of categories of the article.
</p>

<h3 id="h-format">Format of the article</h3>
<p>
The format is the way you want to type in the content of the article. You can provide directly
<strong>HTML</strong> content. This is complex, but it provides a lot of flexibility. You can also provide the
content in an alternative syntax, the so called <strong>Wiki</strong> syntax. The Wiki syntax
is a simplified but powerfull way to provide the content of your articles. It is recommended
to always use the Wiki syntax if you do not have special needs.
</p>
<p>
The description and then each page of an article can have its own format. That way you can
for example use the Wiki syntax for everything but one page where you need to include some
complex HTML code.
</p>

<h3 id="h-status">Status of the article</h3>
<p>
The status of an article defines for example if the article can be seen by the visitors on the website.
Depending on your rights you can set the article as:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>On-Line</dt><dd>The article can be seen on the website.</dd>
<dt>Off-Line</dt><dd>The article is kept in the database but not displayed.</dd>
<dt>In edition</dt><dd>The author (you) is working on the article.</dd>
<dt>Waiting for validation</dt><dd>The author (you) has finished working on the article and is
waiting a reviewer to validate it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Even if you are administrator you cannot put an article on-line without
at least one page. It means that you must save first the article with the <strong>In edition</strong>
status, add a page, and then you can put it online.
</p>

<h3 id="h-comments">Status of the comments</h3>
<p>
The status of the comments defines if the ressource should accept comments by the visitors on the website or not.
Depending on your rights you can set this status to:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Comments open</dt><dd>The comment form is displayed on the resource page.</dd>
<dt>Comments closed</dt><dd>The comment form is not displayed, no comments can be added.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="h-title">Title of the article</h3>
<p>
This should be self explanatory. The title of the article will be displayed on all the pages. But with
a special title you can order the articles within a category.
</p>

<h3>Order of the articles</h3>
<p>
You may want to have a specific order in which you want your articles to be displayed on the website.
For example you have the three articles with the titles <cite>Taxonomy overview</cite>,
<cite>The mammals</cite> and <cite>The fishes</cite> in one category <cite>Taxonomy</cite>.
If you want to have them displayed in this order on the website, just give them the following
titles: <cite><strong>1.</strong> Taxonomy overview</cite>,
<cite><strong>2.</strong> The mammals</cite> and <cite><strong>3.</strong> The fishes</cite>.
</p>
<p>
The numbers <strong>X.</strong> at the start, will be used to order the articles in the
category. You can then configure your category to display or not the number at the start.
</p>

<h3 id="h-description">Description of the article</h3>
<p>
The description of the article is used to describe the article when listed in a category or in
the search page. The is also the description which is used in the RSS feed. The description
is written in the <a href="#h-format">format</a> you have selected. A good description should
give the reader interest to read further. If you are using the Wiki syntax for the format of
the description it is easy to put emphasis on the keywords.
</p>
<p>
The description is also used in the search engine, the words of the description have more
importance for the score than the words in the pages of the article.
</p>

<h3 id="h-keywords">Keywords of the article</h3>
<p>
The keywords are a list of comma delimited words. For example you can put:
<em>Monotremata, Tachyglossidae, Kollikodontidae, Platanistoidae, river dolphins</em>.
The keywords can be composed of 2 words like <em>river dolphins</em>.
</p>
<p>
The keywords are of course used in the internal search engine, but also in the article
page to give more details about the page for the global search engines like Google.
</p>

<h3 id="h-path">Path of the article</h3>
<p>
The path of the article is a critical information. As it will be part of the information
shown in the address bar of the web browser of your visitors. It must be short, easy to
remember and type in. For example if your article is in the category <em>About</em> with
the category path being <em>/about/</em> and you create an article with the path
<em>presentation</em>, your visitors will access it through the web address
<strong>http://yourwebsite.com/about/presentation</strong>.
</p>
<p>
In the case of an article with multiple pages, each pages are accessible with the path
plus the number of the page. For example for the page 3 of the article you can
access it at the web address http://yourwebsite.com/about/presentation<strong>3</strong>.
</p>
<p>
You will see that by default when you type the
<a href="#h-title">title</a> the path is updated. It will most likely be <em>too long</em>
but it is a good start to then get the right one. Keep a maximum of 3 words separated
with the hyphen or minus sign (-). For example you can put:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sport-cars</li>
<li>river-dolphins</li>
<li>apache-installation</li>
</ul>
<p>
Think also that those words are like the most important keywords for the search engines.
</p>

<h3 id="h-publication-date">Publication date</h3>
<p>
The publication date is the date and time at which the article start to be available on
the website. If you give a date and time in the future, you can publish an article while
you are away.
</p>

<h3 id="h-expiration-date">Expiration date</h3>
<p>
The expiration date is the date and time at which the article stop to be available on
the website. You can use this date to create for example a page for a limited time
for a special event. It is recommended not to abuse of it, as visitors through
search engines like not to fall on pages that are not here anymore.
</p>

<h3 id="h-page-number">Page number</h3>
<p>
When editing a page within an article, you can change its position with respect to the
other pages. For example if the page is in position 4, you can then put it in position
2. The other pages will see their position changed to reflect the move of the page from
position 4 to 2.
</p>
<p>
When creating a new page, the default choice is to put the page at the end of the article.
</p>

<h3 id="h-page-title">Page title</h3>
<p>
Each page of an article, even if the article contains only one page, must have a title.
You can consider pages as chapters of the article, so each chapter need a title.
</p>

<h3 id="h-page-content">Page content</h3>
<p>
The page content is the main purpose of your article. Depending of your choice you can
use HTML or the Wiki syntax to enter the content. Do not forget to read carefully what
you are writing being visualizing the content before saving it. The quality
of your writing will make visitors coming again for the information, but also for the
pleasure to read a well written text.
</p>
<p>
Your does not need to be boring, you can insert images and create links to references
on the web.
